# therminator-firefighting-robots
Small robots designed for the Trinity College Fire Fighting Home Robot Contest (http://www.trinityrobotcontest.org/).

All three of these competed in the highschool division back in 2002 and 2003, with Therm 2 and Therm 3 making 5th and 6th place respectively. It's interesting in retrospect considering how there was nothing like the Raspberry Pi and most affordable microcontrollers only had a tiny bit of memory. Also, when budgets are tight, funny things tend to happen like wheels made out of CDs and rubber bands. :-)
